Bots should take care of checking the formatting and the validity of the declaration. As a human reviewer, you should check:

${checkBoxes.join('\n')}

If no document type seems appropriate for this document yet it is relevant to track in this instance, please check if there is already an [open discussion](https://github.com/ambanum/OpenTermsArchive/discussions) about such a type and reference your case there, or open a new discussion if not.

Thanks to your work and attention, Open Terms Archive will ensure that high quality data is available for all reusers, enabling them to do their part in shifting the balance of power towards end users and regulators instead of spending time collecting and cleaning documents üí™
