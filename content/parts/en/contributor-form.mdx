## Sign your contribution

Open Terms Archive is an open source initiative that relies on contributors just like you ðŸ¤—.

By default, your contributions will be anonymous. Signing your contributions with your name and/or email address will enable you to be notified when they are integrated or discussed and to be credited publicly for them.

- While not readable anywhere on the web, this email address will be [publicly](https://stackoverflow.com/a/897604/594053) and irreversibly associated with your contribution.
- We will use this address only if it is necessary to contact you for integrating, crediting or otherwise handling this specific contribution.
- If you have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com), we recommend using an address linked to it so your account is mentioned.

<small>
  If you only want to contribute anonymously, you can leave the default email. You can always join
  the discussion later, but we will not be able to proactively contact you if we have questions.
